Assignment

‘Sikka’ is a money earning app where you can earn cash rewards by completing simple offers daily that give you sikka coins, which you can withdraw to your bank account as real money. You can learn more about this app here Sikka Problem Statement: Users come to this app through different marketing channels. They use the app to complete offers to earn money and we generate revenue in the process. Using the data furnished below, you need to: Calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of the users acquired through different marketing channels
Data to be used:

User Signup data: This table stores the details of every user coming through different marketing channels on ‘Sikka’ app.

User offer completion data: This table stores the data of the offers completed by any ‘Sikka’ user.

Rewards details: This table stores the details of every offer-reward that is in the ‘Sikka’ App

Approach -

We need to calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of the users acquired through different marketing channels.

First let us understand what is LTV, to calculate LTV, we must first estimate how long a customer will continue to use a product or service on an average, and then multiply that figure by the average amount of revenue generated by a customer over each time period (e.g. monthly, yearly). This gives us the total revenue we can expect to receive from that customer over the course of their lifetime.

Let us now look at the steps to calculate it-

2.‘Sikka’ is a type of Incent app. There is another similar incent app called ‘Sikka Pro’. You need to find insights from the data for both these apps and tell which app is better of these two.

User Signup data: This table stores the details of every user coming through different marketing channels on ‘Sikka’ app.

User offer data: This table stores the details of every offer that was initiated on ‘Sikka’ or ‘Sikka pro’ app.

User offer completion data: This table stores the data of the offers completed by any ‘Sikka’ or ‘Sikka pro’ user.

Rewards details: This table stores the details of every offer-reward that is in the ‘Sikka’ or ‘Sikka pro’ App.

Comparison of the apps ‘Sikka’ and ‘Sikka Pro’

The metrics that can be considered to compare which app is better are as follows-

The different tables used for this analysis are- User Signup data, User Offer Initiation data, User Offer Completion data and Reward Details.

Offer Initiation by users

Methodology:-

To carry out the analysis we first merged the datasets User Signup data, User Offer Initiation on the column user_id using pandas merge in python.

To find out the total number of users whose offers were initiated for each app we used group by on ‘app_id’ and ‘started _at’ along with ‘user_id’ and calculated the total user offer initiation counts per day for each app. And after that we visualized the total user offer initiation counts per day for each app.

Next, we also calculated the total offer initiation user count for each app by using group by on columns ‘app_id’ and calculated the total user count for each app. To compare both the apps we visualized the % count of initiated offer of users using a pie chart.

It is observed that the offer initiation by users per day was higher for ‘Sikka’ compared to ‘Sikka Pro’ on the first day. Whereas for the next consecutive days the ‘Sikka Pro’ App had more users taking offers.

Fig2 - % Offer Initiation by users per app Overall the percentage of offer initiation by users for ‘Sikka’ app is more compared to ‘Sikka Pro’.

b. Offer Completion by users

Methodology:-

To carry out the analysis we used the User Offer Completion dataset.

To find out the total number of users whose offers were completed for each app we used group by on ‘app_id’ and ‘completed _at’ along with ‘user_id’ and calculated the total user offer completed counts per day for each app. And after that we visualized the total user offer completed counts per day for each app.

Next, we also calculated the total user offer completion count for each app by using group by on columns ‘app_id’ and calculated the total user count for each app.

To compare both the apps we visualized the % count of completed offers by users using a pie chart. It is observed that the offer completion by users per day was higher for ‘Sikka Pro’ compared to ‘Sikka’.

Overall the percentage of offer completion by users for ‘Sikka Pro’ app is more compared to ‘Sikka’.

c. Rewards earned by users

Methodology:-

To carry out the analysis we merged the User Offer Completion dataset and the reward details.

First we used ‘app_id’ to group the data for each app and calculated the sum of ‘total_payout_per_paise’. And visualized it using a bar plot.

Next, we also calculated the total number of rewards earned from each app by using a group by on columns ‘app_id’ and ‘reward_id’.

To compare both the apps we visualized the % count of rewards earned from each app by users using a pie chart.

The total payout for Sikka Pro is higher than Sikka App.

The percentage of rewards earned by Sikka Pro is more than Sikka.

d. Revenue generated

Methodology:-

To carry out the analysis we used the same merged data of User Offer Completion dataset and the reward details.

First we used ‘app_id’ and 'last login date' to group the data for each app and calculated the sum of ‘total_revenue_per_paise’ generated per day for each app. And visualized it using a bar plot.

Next, we also calculated the total revenue generated for each app by using group by on columns ‘app_id’ and ‘total_revenue_per_paise’.

To compare both the apps we visualized the % total revenue generated for each app using a pie chart.

The total revenue generated per day for Sikka Pro is consecutively higher for the first three days, but on the fourth day the revenue for Sikka is observed to have shown a rapid increase as compared to Sikka_Pro.

The percentage of Total Revenue generated by both the apps is almost similar.

Prediction of the number of referrals for the first 15 days of November.
Here you are given the Install numbers, uninstall numbers, daily signups, number of daily active users and number of referrals made of the ‘Sikka’ app for the month of October 2022. Also, the Install numbers, uninstall numbers, daily signups, number of daily active users for the first 15 days of November is given. You need to predict the number of referrals for these 15 days of November

Methodology:-

Created lagged variables for Referrals, Installs, Uninstalls, Signups, and DAU. Dropped the rows with null values.

Took the original columns as well as the lagged variable columns as X(input features) and ‘Referrals’ as output(y). Also divided them into X_train, X_test and y_train. (First 15 rows for X_train and y_train and last 15 rows for X_test)

Used Linear Regression model from scikit_learn to fit the X_train and y_train.

Then used .predict() on X_test to predict the number of referrals for the first 15 days of November.

Anomaly Detection on ADX_data
ADX is an ad exchange platform for large publishers with significant sales. It supports both Web and mobile apps & game inventories. Through ADX, publishers can sell their ad inventory to advertisers and agencies using real-time bidding technology. AdX provides more efficient usage of ad spaces using real-time auctions. You need to find out if there is any anomaly present in the data for any of the apps present in the sample dataset.

Methodology:-

We need to find the anomalies based on columns 'requests', 'ae_responses', 'ae_impressions', 'ae_clicks', 'ae_revenue'.

Used isolation forest to find the anomalies in the dataset. The algorithm isolates anomalies by calculating how long it takes for each data point to be separated from the majority of the data points.

The isolation forest model is fit on the above mentioned inputs.

Calculated anomaly score using decision function to find whether a data point is an anomaly or not based on the score. The decision function is calculated based on the number of splits it takes to isolate a data point from the rest of the data in the isolation tree.

Next, we used .predict() to find the anomalies and made a new categorical based on the prediction where 1 means not an anomaly and -1 means an anomaly.

Additionally, we visualized the anomalies from the non-anomalous points using pairplots.

Further, we looked at the count of anomalies for each app.

It is observed that when there are more number of requests the clicks, impressions, responses and revenue gets influenced.

Number of anomalies present in the data for each of the apps are given by-

app_id Count of Anomalies

22693095 - 190

63338696 - 82

47862278 - 69

40931528 - 50

43840611 - 49

66981243 - 31

84650721 - 9

From the above table it can be seen that the highest count of anomalies is present in app_id - 22693095, followed by 63338696, further in 47862278 and so on.
